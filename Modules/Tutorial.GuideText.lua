			'Welcome to the basics of dance mode!',
			'Dance is one of the most popular\ngame modes in OutFox.',
			'This tutorial will be the stepping stone\nto help you get your feet moving and grooving.',
			'But first, let\'s get familiar with\nsome of the elements on screen.',

			'This is the song panel.',
			'This provides info for the\ntitle and artist of each song you play.',
			'The growing bar underneath shows you\nhow far in each song you are.',

			'This is the score indicator.',
			'This gives your current score at any point\nin time of the current song or course.',
			'You are scored out of a total of\n100,000,000 Dance Points, or 100%.',

			'This is the life meter, or lifebar.',
			'This shows your current life\nwhich will dictate a pass or fail.',
			'The meter will increase if you\nperform well, and decrease otherwise.',
			'Remember: Life tells you if you\'re doing well,\nand score tells you how well you\'re doing.',

			'Finally, this is your playfield.',
			'These stagnant arrows on top \nare called targets, or receptors.',
			'Pressing the correct pad\nwhen a note is aligned\nwith its corresponding target\nis what scores points.',
			'You get more points if you\nhit the pad when the note\nand target align perfectly.',
			'Notes align with targets\nbased on the music\'s rhythm,\nso trust your ears\nas well as your eyes.',

			'Let\'s go over some note types.',

			'This is a tap note.',
			'For these notes, simply press\non the correct pad.\nWhat your foot does after\ndoes not matter.',
			'Let\'s try out a few of these tap notes.\nDon\'t worry if you miss.\nFocus on the notes.',

			'Next are hold notes.',
			'These notes require you to\nhold your foot on the pad\nuntil the tail reaches the receptors.',
			'If you let go too early,\nyou will drop the hold.\nIt\'s important to keep your foot on the pad\nuntil the entire hold is gone.',
			'Let\'s give some hold notes a shot.',

			'Lastly, let\'s go over jumps.',
			'Two notes on the same row,\nbut on different pads.\nJump on the corresponding pads\nat the same time.',
			'These notes are scored separately.\nEach note will have its own\nscoring for it.',
			'If you miss one note of the jump, but hit the other,\nyou will only be penalized once.',
			'Let\'s see what you\'ve learned so far. Try playing\nwith all the mentioned note types together.',

			'There are still more note types,\nbut you\'ll find these in harder difficulties,\nand later tutorials.',
			'These are just the basics of\ndance mode for Project OutFox.',
			'Check out the other tutorials\nthat are available, or try your feet\nat some charts in the real deal!'
